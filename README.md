## Introduction
### Fine-tuning   
Fine-tuning is a technique used in machine learning to adapt a pre-trained model to a specific task or domain. It involves taking a model that has already been trained on a large dataset for a general task and further training it on a smaller, task-specific dataset. Fine-tuning leverages transfer learning, where knowledge gained from training on one task is transferred to a related task, allowing the model to learn task-specific patterns.
### Pre-trained Models
A pre-trained model is a machine learning model that has been trained on a large dataset for a specific task or domain before being made available for further use. Pre-trained models capture general knowledge and representations of the task they were trained on, making them versatile and adaptable to various downstream tasks.

### Why Fine-tuning is Necessary
While pre-trained models are powerful and versatile, they may not perform optimally on tasks or datasets that are significantly different from the data they were trained on. Fine-tuning allows us to adapt these pre-trained models to specific tasks or domains by leveraging the knowledge they have already acquired during pre-training. By fine-tuning on task-specific data, we can improve the model's performance and tailor it to the specific requirements of the task at hand.

### Overview
This project focuses on fine-tuning the Llama2 model using custom data for specific natural language processing tasks. Llama2 is a state-of-the-art large language model developed by NousResearch, known for its excellent performance in various NLP tasks.

## Steps
### Step 1: Installation
All the required packages for the project are installed using pip. This includes the necessary libraries for accelerated training, transformer models, and additional tools. The specific packages installed include accelerate, peft, bitsandbytes, transformers, and trl.

### Step 2: Importing Libraries
Various libraries are imported to facilitate the fine-tuning process. These include torch for tensor operations, load_dataset from the datasets library for data loading, and transformers for loading the pre-trained Llama2 model and tokenizer. Additionally, the trl library is imported to utilize the SFTTrainer class for supervised fine-tuning.

### Step 3: Setting Parameters
Several parameters are defined to customize the fine-tuning process. These parameters include:

#### Model and Dataset Names:  
Names of the pre-trained Llama2 model and the dataset used for fine-tuning.
#### LoRA Parameters: 
Parameters related to LoRA (Low Rank Adoption) configuration, including attention dimension, alpha parameter, and dropout probability.
#### BitsandBytes Configuration: 
Parameters for configuring 4-bit precision base model loading, such as compute data type and quantization type.
#### Training Arguments: 
Parameters related to training, such as output directory, number of training epochs, batch sizes, optimization settings, and learning rate schedule.
#### SFT Parameters:
 Parameters specific to supervised fine-tuning, including maximum sequence length, packing, and device mapping.
### Step 4: Loading and Fine-tuning
The dataset is loaded using the load_dataset function from the datasets library. This function allows easy loading and processing of datasets from the Hugging Face model hub. The tokenizer and model with LoRA configuration are then loaded from the Hugging Face model hub using the AutoTokenizer and AutoModelForCausalLM classes, respectively.

The training process is initiated using the SFTTrainer class from the trl library. This class facilitates supervised fine-tuning of the model on the provided dataset. During fine-tuning, the model learns to adapt to the specific task defined by the dataset.

### Step 5: Saving Trained Model
Once the fine-tuning process is complete, the trained model is saved for future use. This ensures that the fine-tuned model can be easily loaded and utilized without needing to retrain it from scratch.

### Step 6: Text Generation
To evaluate the trained model, text generation is performed using a text generation pipeline. Prompted inputs are provided to the model, and the model generates text outputs based on its learned patterns and knowledge from the fine-tuning process. This step allows assessing the model's performance and generating text relevant to the task at hand.

### Step 7: Model Merging and Deployment
Finally, the trained model is merged with the original Llama2 model to create a unified model with the fine-tuned weights. This merged model is then deployed to the Hugging Face model hub for community use. Additionally, the tokenizer associated with the model is deployed to ensure compatibility with the deployed model.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of fine-tuning the Llama2 model with custom data for specific natural language processing tasks. Each step, from data loading to model deployment, is carefully executed to ensure the successful adaptation of the model to the task at hand. The fine-tuned model can be utilized for various NLP tasks, showcasing the versatility and adaptability of transformer models in real-world applications.
